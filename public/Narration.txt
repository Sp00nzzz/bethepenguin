but one of them caught our eye the one in the center he would neither go towards the feeding grounds at the edge of the ice nor return to the colony shortly afterwards we saw him heading straight towards the mountains some seventy kilometers away dr ainey explained that even if he caught him and brought him back to the colony he would immediately head right back for the mountains
